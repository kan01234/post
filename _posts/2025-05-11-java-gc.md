## 🧬 Inside the JVM: How Java Garbage Collectors Track, Mark, and Sweep Objects

Garbage Collection (GC) isn’t just about freeing memory — it's a fundamental part of how the JVM manages *object lifecycle and reachability*. To truly understand memory performance in Java applications, especially when handling large datasets (like our CSV export pipeline), we need to go beyond “heap is full = GC runs”.

Let’s break down how GC **really works** — from object references to pointer marking, and color-based marking phases used internally by collectors like G1GC and Shenandoah.

### 🧭 GC Roots & Object Graph Traversal

GC begins with a set of known **GC roots** — objects that are always reachable:

- **Local variables** on the stack  
- **Static fields**  
- **JNI references**  
- **Thread objects**  
- **System classes**

From these roots, GC walks the **object reference graph**, recursively following pointers from root objects to others.

If an object **isn’t reachable** from any root, it is *garbage* and can be collected.

---

### 🎨 Object Coloring: White, Gray, Black

Most modern GCs (including G1GC) use a **tri-color marking algorithm** to track which objects are live.

- **White**: Initially, *all* objects are white — assumed unreachable.  
- **Gray**: Objects found reachable but whose children haven’t yet been scanned.  
- **Black**: Reachable objects whose children *have* been scanned.

#### ✅ Marking Phase (Tri-color Marking)

1. All objects start as **white**.  
2. GC starts with GC roots → marks them **gray** (reachable but not yet fully scanned).  
3. For each **gray** object:
   - Mark its references (children) gray
   - Mark the object itself **black** (fully scanned)  
4. At the end, **only white objects remain unreachable** → eligible for collection.

This avoids cycles, and ensures even deeply nested object graphs are scanned safely.

### 📌 Reference Types and Reachability

Java has multiple reference levels, and GC behavior depends on them:

| Reference Type       | Collected When Memory Needed? | Use Case             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Strong Reference** | ❌ Never                      | Default (`new Object()`) |
| **Soft Reference**   | ✅ When memory is low         | Caches               |
| **Weak Reference**   | ✅ On next GC                 | Maps, metadata       |
| **Phantom Reference**| ✅ After finalization         | Cleanup hooks        |

If your batch job holds strong references to large lists or maps (e.g., `List<Entity>`), those will not be collected even under pressure.

---

### 🪄 Barriers & Pointer Traversal

GCs that run **concurrently** with your app (like G1GC, Shenandoah, ZGC) must handle **pointer updates during GC**.

They use **read and write barriers**:

- **Write barrier**: Intercepts field assignments to track reference changes  
- **Read barrier**: (used by Shenandoah, ZGC) intercepts reads to remap pointers during GC relocation

These barriers are critical for **concurrent and low-pause collectors** to work correctly while your app continues to allocate and modify memory.

### ⚙️ G1GC Behavior: Region-Based Heap and Incremental GC

G1GC divides the heap into **equal-sized regions** (1MB–32MB each) instead of strict Young/Old generations.

#### Key Phases:

- **Initial Mark**: Marks GC roots; piggybacks on a minor GC  
- **Concurrent Mark**: Traces object graph concurrently  
- **Remark**: Finalizes marking in a STW (stop-the-world) pause  
- **Cleanup**: Reclaims unused regions, re-evaluates liveness

Each region is tagged as Eden, Survivor, or Old — but G1 is flexible and can reassign region roles.

#### Key Feature:
G1GC chooses *which regions to collect* based on **garbage density** (garbage/region size) → hence the name *Garbage-First*.

### 🌈 Which GCs Use Tri-Color Marking?

Tri-color marking is **central to modern concurrent GCs** — it’s how they track object reachability *without stopping your application*. But not all collectors use it.

#### ✅ GCs that use tri-color marking:

| GC                  | Uses Tri-Color? | Notes                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **G1GC**            | ✅ Yes          | During concurrent marking, uses tri-color to identify reachable objects. |
| **Shenandoah**      | ✅ Yes          | Employs concurrent tri-color marking with **barriers** to minimize pause time. |
| **ZGC**             | ✅ Yes          | Uses a **color-in-pointer** scheme; conceptually tri-color with advanced pointer tagging. |
| **CMS (deprecated)**| ✅ Yes          | Legacy concurrent GC using tri-color for live object discovery.         |
| **Serial GC**       | ❌ No           | Performs full STW (stop-the-world) marking; doesn’t need tri-color.     |
| **Parallel GC**     | ❌ No           | Optimized for throughput with STW collection; skips incremental marking logic. |

Tri-color is especially useful when the GC **runs concurrently** with application threads. The algorithm prevents issues like:

- Collecting objects still in use (e.g., due to race conditions)
- Missing new references created mid-GC

By coloring objects **white (unreachable)**, **gray (reachable but not fully scanned)**, and **black (fully scanned)**, the GC guarantees memory safety during concurrent traversals.

### 📉 Example: Why You Might Have Long GCs in a Batch Job

If you load 10M records from DB:

- You create millions of objects → large Eden occupancy  
- GC kicks in frequently to handle allocation pressure  
- If Camel or your code holds onto references (e.g., in Exchange headers), objects get promoted to Old Gen  
- Full GCs (stop-the-world) start happening once Old Gen is full → latency spikes, possible OOM

### 🧠 Final Thought: GC Is a Tool, Not Magic

Knowing the GC is **not just about tuning flags** — it’s about knowing:

- *How your code allocates and retains memory*  
- *How the JVM finds and reclaims unused memory*  
- *What references are keeping your objects alive*

You can’t fix memory problems just by increasing heap size. The solution often lies in **rethinking object lifecycles**, reducing reference retention, and allowing the GC to do its job effectively.
