## Requrimetns

A Linux-powered edge device, operating in a remote setting, runs a program that generates periodic debug or error log messages. These logs are currently channeled through the system's default syslog mechanism.

The main features is allows an operator to remotely access log messages from the edge device though secure cloud server

To conserve network bandwidth and cloud storage, the device should only upload logs when explicitly requested by the operator, and only the specific logs that the operator needs.

### Assumption

#### Estimated Log Message Length

Let's make some estimations of the log message:

    Timestamp: 23 characters (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS)
    Log Level: 5 characters
    PID: Assuming a typical PID length of 5 digits
    Thread Name: 15 characters
    Logger Name: Let's assume an average of 20 characters
    Log Message: This is variable, but let's stick with our previous assumption of 100 bytes on average
    Exception Stack Trace: This is highly variable, but let's assume an average of 500 bytes when present (this can be adjusted based on your application's exception handling)
    Other characters and formatting: Let's add a buffer of 20 bytes for colons, spaces, and other formatting elements

#### Estimated Log Message / Day

Calculating the Average Log Message size:

    Log per day: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 (up to ms)
    Log message length with exception: 688 bytes
    Log message length without exception: 188 bytes
    Probability of exception: 10%

log message size = 86,400,000 * 10% * 688 bytes * 10% + 86,400,000 * 188 bytes = 20GB

- Daily Directories: Logs are organized into directories named after the date (YYYY-MM-DD) they were generated.
- Hourly Subdirectories: Within each daily directory, there are subdirectories for each hour (00 to 23).
- Minutely Log Files: Inside the hourly directories, log files are created for each minute, following the naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM[_error].json.gz. The optional _error suffix denotes files containing error logs with exception stack traces.
- Sequence Numbers: If multiple log files are generated within the same minute (due to high volume or size limits), they are differentiated using sequence numbers (e.g., _1, _2, etc.).
- Compression: Log files are compressed using gzip (.gz extension), significantly reducing their storage footprint.

#### Estimated File Sizes

| Log Type   | Uncompressed Size (approx.) | Calculation                               | Compressed Size (gzip, approx.) |
|------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Non-Error  | 10.9 MB                     | 60,000 logs/min * 188 bytes/log / 1024^2 | 1.2 MB (50% compression)        |
| Error      | 4.13 MB                     | 60,000 logs/min * 10% * 500 bytes/log / 1024^2  | 0.25 MB (50% compression)        |

#### Log Rotation

Rotation Rules (Inferred):

- Time-Based Rotation: Log files are rotated every minute, creating a new file for each new minute.
- Size-Based Rotation (Optional): The presence of sequence numbers suggests that log files might also be rotated if they exceed a certain size limit, even within the same minute.
- Compression: Compression is likely applied immediately after rotation to save storage space.
- Error Log Separation: Error logs are separated into distinct files, potentially allowing for different retention policies or handling compared to non-error logs.
